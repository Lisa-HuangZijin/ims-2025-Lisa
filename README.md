# ims-2025-Lisa

### Week 1

- created a github repo for the class
- first time to use the wiki page
  - learned some basic formatting written in Markdown

[assignment1](https://editor.p5js.org/Lisa-HuangZijin/sketches/7j5JbKo39)  
For assignment1, I mainly explore creating 3D object using p5js, and try to “render” it in a different way-this isn’t rendering in the traditional sense using p5.js. Instead, I’m using `beginShape()` and `endShape()` to draw each face of the object individually, so that each face can have a different color — because I didn’t really like the built-in p5.js render styles and colors, haha.

### Week 2

- used p5 mirror to have a local copy of all my p5 sketches (though met the problem that it failed to download my sketch named in Chinese ;-))
- first time run terminal inside Visual studio code!

[assignment2](https://editor.p5js.org/Lisa-HuangZijin/sketches/J3SNMDiYw)  
For assignment2, I tweaked my earlier sketch based on spring force (from [**The Nature of Code**](https://wp.nyu.edu/lisa_huang/category/nature-of-code/) )to make it responsive — it now adjusts to the window size and can go fullscreen.

### Week 3

- learned about local storage, which could be very useful for supporting lightweight collaboration features—like saving each person’s input and combining them later to create a shared experience, or creating personalized interactive experiences that remember the viewer’s actions over time.
- learned how to make change on canvas using URL

[small documentation](https://www.notion.so/ims03-url-for-sketch-1d244b9cec2880ae8e57d594de0eebbe)  
For assignment3, I used the example code provided by the professor to let the users be able to edit the color of the butterfly using URL.
